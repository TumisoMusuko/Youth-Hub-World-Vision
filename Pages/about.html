    <h2>Organization Overview</h2>
    <p>World Vision International is a global humanitarian organization that is been helping vulnerable children and communities since 1950. Founded by Dr. Bob Pierce, the organization strongly believes that every child deserves the chance to grow up healthy, safe, and full of hope.</p>
    <p>Today, World Vision works in nearly 100 countries, providing life-changing support through programs focused on child protection, education, healthcare, clean water, food security, and emergency relief.</p>
    <p>Although Christian-based, World Vision supports anyone in need regardless of faith, race, or background. Its child sponsorship program is one of the most impactful initiatives, ensuring long-term transformation for both children and their communities.</p>
    <p>In South Africa, World Vision focuses on poverty, lack of education, and poor access to clean waterâ€”helping children and families build a better future.</p>
